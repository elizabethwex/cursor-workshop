  <h1>GitHub basics</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>GitHub</strong> is where we store and share code. Think of it like a shared drive for projects, with history so we can see what changed and when.
  </p>

  <h2>What’s a repo?</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>repository</strong> (or “repo”) is a project folder that lives on GitHub. It contains all the files for that project, plus the history of changes. When you clone a repo, you copy it to your computer so you can work on it.
  </p>

  <h2>Why we use it</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Everyone works from the same place and can see the latest version.</li>
    <li>Changes are tracked, so we can see who did what and when.</li>
    <li>We can collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Create a GitHub account</h2>
  <p>
    If you don’t have an account yet, go to <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/join</a> and sign up. It’s free. Once you’re in, you’ll be able to clone repos and, when you’re ready, push your own changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next: <a href="/cursor-workshop/clone-and-run/">Clone and run</a> – we’ll clone this workshop repo and get it running on your computer.
