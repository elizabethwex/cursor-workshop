  <h1>Clone and run</h1>
  <p>
    Follow these steps to copy this workshop to your computer and run it in your browser. This is the same flow you’ll use for other projects: clone, open in Cursor, install, run.
  </p>

  <StepCard number={1} title="Clone the repo">
    <p>
      Open a terminal (or use the one inside Cursor: Terminal → New Terminal). Then run the command below. Replace <code>your-username</code> with the GitHub username or org that owns this repo.
    </p>
    <CopyButton text="git clone https://github.com/your-username/cursor-workshop.git" />
    <p>This creates a folder called <code>cursor-workshop</code> with all the project files.</p>
  </StepCard>

  <StepCard number={2} title="Open the folder in Cursor">
    <p>
      In Cursor: <strong>File → Open Folder</strong> (or Cmd+O / Ctrl+O). Choose the <code>cursor-workshop</code> folder you just cloned.
    </p>
  </StepCard>

  <StepCard number={3} title="Install dependencies">
    <p>
      In the terminal (you can use the one at the bottom of Cursor), run:
    </p>
    <CopyButton text="npm install" />
    <p>This downloads the packages the project needs. Wait until it finishes.</p>
  </StepCard>

  <StepCard number={4} title="Start the dev server">
    <p>In the same terminal, run:</p>
    <CopyButton text="npm run dev" />
    <p>
      The site will start. You should see a message like “Local: http://localhost:4321” (or another port). Open that link in your browser – you’re now viewing the workshop from your own computer.
    </p>
  </StepCard>
